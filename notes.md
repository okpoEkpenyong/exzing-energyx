**Subject:** Re: Scoping Call and Project Details

Dear \[Name],

Thank you for reaching out. I’d be happy to schedule a 30-minute scoping call this week to walk you through our project and discuss potential support opportunities. Below are my available slots:

* **Tuesday, May 6**: 10:00 AM – 12:00 PM WAT
* **Wednesday, May 7**: 3:00 PM – 5:00 PM WAT
* **Friday, May 9**: 11:00 AM – 2:00 PM WAT

Please feel free to confirm a time that works for you.

In the meantime, here’s the information you requested:

---

### 🔹 **Brief Description of the Solution**

We are building **Exzing-EnergyX**, a modular digital platform that provides **carbon tracking**, **IoT-based emissions data ingestion**, and **carbon credit tokenization** services for organizations and sustainability stakeholders. It enables businesses to monitor their greenhouse gas emissions (Scopes 1–3), track sequestration projects (e.g., CCS/forestation), and trade verified carbon credits through a blockchain-backed ledger.

---

### 🌍 **Region**

* **Primary**: EMEA (initial deployment and operations in Nigeria)
* **Future Expansion**: Global (via multi-region Azure services)

---

### 🏭 **Industry**

* Energy / Climate Tech / Carbon Markets / Environmental Services

---

### ☁️ **Main Azure Services Deployed / Planned**

* **Azure App Services** (Web APIs and UI Hosting)
* **Azure SQL Database** (Structured data and emissions logs)
* **Azure IoT Hub** (Future integration for real-time device telemetry)
* **Azure Key Vault** (Secrets and certificate management)
* **Azure Active Directory B2C** (Multi-tenant identity and access)
* **Microsoft Sustainability APIs** (for emission factors and tracking)
* **Azure Container Apps / Functions** (Microservice backend options)
* **Azure Confidential Ledger** (For blockchain-backed credit traceability)

---

### 🔧 **Any Non-Azure Services**

* GitHub (CI/CD via Actions)
* Possibly IPFS or Hyperledger (for credit registry extension)

---

### ⚠️ **Current Challenges**

* Scalable architecture for processing IoT + user data efficiently
* Emissions data standardization and API integration
* Cost forecasting for long-term deployment
* Determining the best practices for blockchain-based registry compliance

---

### ✅ **Expected Outcome of the Review**

* Guidance on Azure service selection and optimization (cost/performance/security)
* Architecture validation for scalability and multi-region support
* Best practices for integrating Microsoft sustainability services
* Direction on DevOps setup and Identity Management

---

### ✅ **Extra Look Ahead**

> As part of our long-term roadmap, we plan to integrate **carbon capture and sequestration (CCS)** technologies into the platform, with a focus on **repurposing abandoned or depleted oil wells** across West Africa for underground CO₂ storage. This will enable us to extend our carbon platform from digital tracking and credit trading into actual emissions mitigation. We're currently exploring feasibility studies, regulatory requirements, and infrastructure partnerships to support this future expansion.

We are currently drafting a high-level architecture diagram and will share it with you prior to the call.

Looking forward to your confirmation.
